# Sublime and Code settings

This repo contains the settings I use for my personal code editors (Sublime Text 3 and Visual Studio Code).

## Sublime Text 3

Browse to your User folder in ST3. It is usually at the path C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages, or you can find it by clicking on Preferences > Browse Packages...

Then copy the files in the st3 folder of this repo to your User folder and restart Sublime.

Ta dah! Your settings have been restored.

## Visual Studio Code

Start VS Code and go to the command bar (Ctrl + Shift + P). Then type "open settings json" and select the first option. Select to "Save as..." (Ctrl + Shift + S) and write down the path that shows up in the window. It will usually be C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User.

Now copy the contents of the vsc folder in this repo to that path, except for extensions.txt

This file contains the names of the extensions that should be **manually** installed.

Once again... TA DAH!!!
